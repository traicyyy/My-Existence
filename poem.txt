My Existence

Unaware, someone reached out to me, 
Through all the years I've lived, you see, 
I believed my existence was a void, 
But I was wrong; I truly enjoyed.

Time passed and brought changes anew, 
Nothing remained the same, it's true, 
Emotions coursing through my veins, 
Whispering I might be happy, like refrains.

I've caused pain to others, this I confess, 
Regret follows me closely, no less, 
But I'm striving to improve each day, 
Hoping their forgiveness comes my way.

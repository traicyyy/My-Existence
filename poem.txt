My Existence: From Shadows to Solace

Unaware, someone reached out to me, 
Through all the years I've lived, you see, 
I believed my existence was a void, 
But I was wrong; I truly enjoyed.

Time passed and brought changes anew, 
Nothing remained the same, it's true, 
A surge of joy warmed my chest, 
Mingling with the icy chill of regret.

I've caused pain to others, this I confess, 
Regret lingered like a shadow, weighing down my steps, 
But I'm striving to improve each day, 
Hoping their forgiveness comes my way.

The solace found in forgiveness, 
A tender balm to soothe the heart,
Yet the shadows of deeds remain, 
Lessons learned, humanity's part.

Is kindness such a difficult art? 
To isolate, ignore their cries? 
When someone asks, "Where is the love?" 
Will you remain silent, heart cold as ice? 

I hope not.
